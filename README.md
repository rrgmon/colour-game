# Colour Game

**Guess the colour using the RGB value**

> ### **What is RGB**?
>
> ---
>
> **RGB** stands for - _Red, Green and Blue_.
>
> Every colour is a combination of these three main colours. For example, the colour white can be shown as **rgb(255, 255, 255)** and the colour black can be shown as **rgb(0, 0, 0)**.
>
> The three values stand for the amount of Red, Green or Blue. **[ rgb(red, green, blue) ]**
>
> So in the case of colour white, the colours red, green and blue should have the max values. The values range from 0 - 255. Any colour can be created with a combination of these values.

Enough with the theory, and now go have fun playing the game. Hope it helps you with understanding the world of RGB!
